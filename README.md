# rotateStarWithinMatrix
Rotates elements found on diagonals and up and down (star pattern) by 45 degrees, t times

Coding Challenge:
Consider a (2k+1) × (2k+1) square subarray of an integer integers matrix. Let's call the union of the square's two longest diagonals, middle column and middle row a star. Given the coordinates of the star's center in the matrix and its width, rotate it 45 · t degrees clockwise preserving position of all matrix elements that do not belong to the star.
